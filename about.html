                <p>
                    We are riders - that fact has guided our every decision since 1974. 
                    When quality tires weren't around, we strove to make the best. 
                    When people wanted to ride cruisers in the dirt, we made the first production mountain bike. 
                    When roadies wanted to go faster, we doubled down on carbon and built our own wind tunnel. 
                    And when we saw kids struggling to focus in school, we began supporting Outride to help promote better health through cycling.
